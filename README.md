# multi_robot_SLAM_separators
WIP
The goal of this project is to detect separators (transforms) between frames of the same places encountered by different robots for multi-robot SLAM.

Use [Tegra Docker](https://github.com/Technica-Corporation/Tegra-Docker) to see how to use the GPU on the Jetson TX within Docker (for NetVLAD).
