# multi_robot_SLAM_separators
WIP 

The goal of this project is to detect separators (transforms) between frames of the same places encountered by different robots for multi-robot SLAM

Nothing is functional or ready to use just yet :)

If you plan to use a TX2, make sure to have a look at [Tegra Docker](https://github.com/Technica-Corporation/Tegra-Docker).
